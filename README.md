# auronia
Development documentation tools for automated AI development, using TypeScript and JSON.

## Overview

Auronia is a library that converts Markdown documents to JSON format using TypeScript and Deno with AI composer, making them easily interpretable by AI systems.

When executed, it transforms development requirements written in Markdown into structured JSON that can serve as development instructions for AI.

Through learning the Auronia syntax, AI systems can interpret these JSON structures to understand development requirements and specifications.

The library is designed to work with AI development agents like Cursor and VSCode's Cline. The design is specifically optimized for Cursor and Cline as these are the primary tools used by the author. While the underlying AI model is based on Claude-3.5-sonnet, the syntax and structure are designed to be easily interpretable by other AI models as well.

## Key Features

- Markdown to JSON conversion optimized for AI interpretation
- TypeScript implementation with Deno runtime
- Structured format for automated AI development
- Learning-friendly syntax for AI systems
- Optimized for Cursor and Cline AI development agents
- Compatible with Claude-3.5-sonnet and other AI models

## Purpose

The goal is to bridge the gap between human-written specifications and AI-interpretable instructions by providing a standardized way to express development requirements that both humans and AI can work with effectively.
